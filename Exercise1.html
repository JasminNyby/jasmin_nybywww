        Britney Spears’ first solo art exhibition is happening
    </h1> <p> Pop star; fashion icon; not a girl, not yet a woman: <b>Britney Spears</b> can do it all, and in 2017 she added ‘artist’ to her impressive roster of titles after sharing a video of herself painting on Instagram. Now, a gallery in France has announced that it will be displaying the singer’s original artwork as part of her “first solo show”.
    </p> <p> The show is titled <i><b>Sometimes you just gotta play!!!!!!</b></i> after the caption Spears gave her IG post, and will run “till the world ends” – a nod to her 2011 song of the same name. The gallery’s website doesn’t offer any further details, leaving fans to speculate whether the exhibition actually involves Spears or is simply an unofficial show centred on the musician’s debut artwork.
