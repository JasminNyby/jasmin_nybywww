        <p>Ä (lower case ä) is a character that represents either a letter from several extended Latin alphabets, 
        or the letter A with an umlaut mark or diaeresis. The letter Ä occurs as an independent letter in the 
        Finnish, Swedish, Skolt Sami, Karelian, Estonian, Luxembourgish, North Frisian, Saterlandic, Emiliano-Romagnolo,Rotuman, Slovak, Tatar, Gagauz, and Turkmen alphabets, where it represents a vowel sound.</p>
        
        <p>In the Nordic countries, the vowel sound [æ] was originally written as "Æ" when Christianisation caused the former Vikings to start using the Latin alphabet around A.D. 1100. Finnish adopted the Swedish alphabet during the 700 years that Finland was part of Sweden. Although the phenomenon of Germanic umlaut does not exist in Finnish, the phoneme /æ/ does. </p>

<!--The differences between HTML & HTML5:

    In brief, I've learned that using HTML5 feautures makes html code easier to format, understand and read. HTML5 has semantic elements, which doesn't really affect the appearance of the website, but helping organizing and formating the document.
